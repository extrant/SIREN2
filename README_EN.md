- <font color=red>At the same time, I will check if your game contains any Rikudou plugins. If there are any traces of Rikudou plugins in the game, the game will be crash.</font>


- <font color=red>I don't know why I can't discuss any content about hacks in a channel belonging to plugins(hack), which is something I can't understand. Is it not allowed to recommend other free plugins in the paid plugin channel that are not affiliated with Minion? Or will free hacks affect your channel reputation? Why don't you make your Rikudou plugin an external plugin instead of limiting others' speech like a bitch in the channel, if you want to separate it from external plugins? What are you afraid of?</font>
