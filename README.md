**SIREN2** : Half open source pvp plugin, based on FFDraw & Python..

### Features

- Far beyond any function that your green gaming brain can think of;
- The most basic Hack content, sourced from FPT;
- Implementation of basic PVP function and hack function adaptation;
- It's completely free, it's just not letting you green players come in and make you angry;
- Based on the FFDraw framework, it can be turned off and on as needed. There is no need to restart the game unless it is necessary;
